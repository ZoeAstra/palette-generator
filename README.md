## Overview
A simple palette generator in Next.js with shadcn components and tailwind, made after my frustration with existing ones. Kind of a spur-of-the-moment project I'm working on for fun in my spare time. It's nowhere near complete yet (not even an MVP, really), but it has a few basic functionalities:

- Generates palette swatches using oklch and some clever math
- Add more rows (or remove them)
- Add more columns (removal not implemented)
- Select color for each row via slider or numeric hue input

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
